    {
      question: "What kind of events do you attend as a fursuit photographer?",
      answer: "I (at least for the time being) attend only outings and private meetups. These events  for fursuiters allow them to wear their costumes and interact with others who share similar interests, and they also offer opportunities for photographers to capture images of fursuits in action, both individually and in group."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I book a photoshoot with you?",

      question: "What should I bring to the photoshoot?",
      answer: "Well, mainly you and your fursuit of course! And you probably shouldn't forget some water. Other things/details will be discussed individually."
    },
    {

    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to receive my photos after the photoshoot?",
      answer: "Your photos will be delivered within 14 days after the day of the photoshoot. If you want to have the photos delivered sooner, there's an rush editing option. That means your photos will be delivered within 48 hours! This option will cost you +20% of your initial price."
    },
    {

      question: "Do you offer outdoor photoshoots?",
      answer: "Yes, for sure. Expect most of my photoshoots to be outside. But I can rent a photostudio if needed. The rent will be added to your final price."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you do photoshoots in different locations?",
      answer: "Yes, but I don’t have a car, so ideally the location should be accessible by train/public transport. Other details can be discussed individually."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I receive my photos after the photoshoot?",
      answer: "Your photos will be delivered within 14 days of the photoshoot via Google Drive in a *.jpg format. Unedited (RAW) photos are stored for 1 month after the photoshoot. If you want to claim a complaint, you have to it within that 1-month period!"

    {
      question: "Do you have a refund or cancellation policy?",
      answer: "Yes, I do. If you, as customer, cancel or reschedule the photoshoot, you have to do it with adequate advance – at least 3 days in advance. In other case, you’re not eligible for refund!"
    },
    {
      question: "Do you have any other questions?",
      answer: "If so, you can contact me on Telegram and ask me about it."
